# Prediction Market Platform

## Project Description

A decentralized prediction market platform built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to bet on real-world events in a trustless manner. The platform leverages smart contracts to facilitate transparent betting, automated fund management, and fair outcome resolution through oracle integration. Users can create prediction markets for various events and place bets on YES or NO outcomes, with winnings automatically calculated based on the betting pool distribution.



## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize prediction markets by creating a fully decentralized, transparent, and accessible platform where anyone can participate in forecasting real-world events. By removing intermediaries and leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to build a trustless ecosystem where market outcomes are verifiable, funds are secure, and participants are rewarded fairly based on collective wisdom. We envision this platform becoming a go-to solution for decentralized event prediction across sports, politics, finance, and social events.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Market Creation**: Anyone can create prediction markets for real-world events without requiring permission from centralized authorities.
- **Transparent Betting Mechanism**: All bets are recorded on-chain, ensuring complete transparency and immutability of betting records.
- **Dual-Outcome Betting**: Users can place bets on YES or NO outcomes, creating a simple yet effective prediction mechanism.

- **Secure Token Handling**: Integration with Aptos Coin (APT) ensures secure and efficient token transfers.
- **Real-time Pool Tracking**: The platform tracks total bets on each outcome, allowing users to see market sentiment in real-time.

## Future Scope

- **Oracle Integration**: Implement automated oracle services (like Chainlink or Pyth Network) to verify real-world event outcomes and trigger automatic market resolution.
- **Multi-Outcome Markets**: Expand beyond binary YES/NO predictions to support multiple outcomes for more complex events.
- **Liquidity Pools**: Introduce automated market maker (AMM) mechanisms to improve liquidity and enable continuous betting.
- **Time-Locked Markets**: Add functionality for markets with specific start and end times, with automatic resolution deadlines.
